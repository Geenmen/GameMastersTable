    "description": "A Rolling Pebble is a small, animated boulder that roams mountainous and rocky terrains. Though it appears as nothing more than an ordinary rock, it possesses a curious nature and a surprising amount of strength. Rolling Pebbles are often seen moving in groups, rolling down hills and crashing into anything in their path. They are known to form symbiotic relationships with larger elemental beings, acting as scouts or even as projectiles in battle. Some adventurers have discovered that, with patience and the right approach, a Rolling Pebble can be tamed and kept as a loyal, albeit peculiar, pet.",
