    "description": "The Driftwood Crab is a large, amphibious creature with a carapace resembling the weathered remains of a small shipwreck. This natural camouflage allows it to blend seamlessly into coastal environments, often being mistaken for debris from a shipwreck. It uses this disguise to ambush unsuspecting prey or to avoid predators. Its sturdy claws are powerful enough to snap through thick ropes or wooden beams, further adding to the illusion that it's just another piece of wreckage until it moves.",
