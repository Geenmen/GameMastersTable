Her voice can be heard echoing through the trees, luring travelers deeper into the woods. While not inherently malicious, she enjoys playing tricks on those who enter her domain, often leading them in circles or causing them to lose their way. The nymph appears as a beautiful, ethereal woman with a translucent form that shimmers like a reflection on water.",
