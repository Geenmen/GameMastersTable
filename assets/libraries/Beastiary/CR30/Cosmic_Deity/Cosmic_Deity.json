    "description": "The Cosmic Deity is a vast and apathetic celestial being, ancient beyond comprehension. It drifts through the void between worlds, indifferent to the mortal struggles that play out across the planes. Though it rarely interferes, the Cosmic Deity is known to bestow its favor upon those who embrace the concept of 'progression'â€”the continual advancement of knowledge, power, and understanding. Worshipers of the Cosmic Deity are driven by a relentless pursuit of progress, whether through technology, magic, or personal growth. This deity rewards those who innovate and evolve, while those who stagnate are met with indifference or subtle disdain.",
